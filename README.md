# IndexOf Enhanced

IndexOf Enhanced is an enhanced version of Apache Webserver's directory listing (IndexOf) that should work on any webserver running PHP. It's highly customizable and it comes with a dark and a light theme.

It comes in two versions: indexofand indexof_not-sortable . The first is the full featured version of the script and lets the user sort files and directories. The latter is a light version of the script with a few less features. Remarkably files (and directories) can't be sorted because aren't stored into memory first (into an array) which should perform better for less powerful systems or very large directories.
